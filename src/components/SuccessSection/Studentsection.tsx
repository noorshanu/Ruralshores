              I could not study further after passing 10th because my
              family&apos;s financial condition was not good. And I had to do
              labor work. But here I got training as an electrician in a short
              period of time. And they gave me a good job so that I became
              financially stable and today I can support my family financially.

              Before I got training here I was weak in speaking in front of

              I learned about the skill development training conducted by the

              I am now self-confident. They focus on the welfare of children and
              the development of women. I got married at a young age and didn’t
              know what to do when problems arose. Completing the Vihaan

              My trainees trust me because I don’t judge them. I support them.
              And when they go out and start earning, they come back and say,
              “Sir, because of you, my life changed.” That makes all the hard
              work worth it. RSA helped me understand that I’m not just training
              for sales—I’m building women’s confidence.

            RSA emphasizes practical learning and problem-solving, which has been more effective in building confidence and skills. From my managerial and training experience at RSA, I’ve learned the importance of adaptability . To make my classes engaging, I incorporate interactive activities, group discussions, and role-playing, ensuring students stay active and involved.
